# ig_backup
Backup photos and highlighted stories on Instagram

## How to use
1. `npm i`
2. `node main.js --target={BACKUP_TARGETS_USERNAME}`

Optional: `--username={YOUR_USERNAME} --password={YOUR_PASSWORD}`

p.s: Everything runs locally, your username and password will not expose to the public.
Use this wisely, Do not run with your username and password too many times per day, Instagram might block your account if you login too many times. A fake account is recommended for public users account.
